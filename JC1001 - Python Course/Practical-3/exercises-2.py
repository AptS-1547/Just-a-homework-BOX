Write a program that reads a letter from the English alphabet from the user. If the 
letter is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u) then it should inform the user that it is a vowel. If the 
user enters a (y), then the user should be informed that a y can sometimes be a 
vowel and sometimes is not. For all other input letters, the program should inform 
the user that it is a consonant.
