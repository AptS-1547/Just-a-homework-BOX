"""Tasks:
Modify the Vehicle class from previous exercises to include the attribute 
capacity. The Vehicle class should have only one method, ticketPrice which 
returns an integer of the capacity multiplied by 100. Create a Bus class which 
inherits from Vehicle but overrides the ticketPrice method, to add an extra 10% 
to the ticketPrice to cover maintenance costs.
