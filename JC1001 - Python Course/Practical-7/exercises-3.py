"""Tasks:
Modify the Vehicle class from exercise 1 and 2, to a method, seating_capacity. 
This method should return a string that reports the name of the vehicle and the 
seating capacity. Within the Bus class, override the seating_capacity method so 
that the default value of seating capacity is set to 40. Instantiate the Bus class 
as before, then print a call from the Bus object calling the seatingCapacity 
method i.e. print(myBus.seatingCapacity())
