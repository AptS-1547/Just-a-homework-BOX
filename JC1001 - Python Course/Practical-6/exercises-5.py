"""Tasks:
Write a program for the task in exercise 3 using dictionary comprehension. If you 
have already used dictionary comprehension previously, write the program using 
a for loop.

Tasks3:
Write a program that creates a new dictionary by extracting specific keys from 
another dictionary. Below is an example dictionary you can use and a list 
containing the specific keys we want to extract to create our new dictionary. 
Remember to print the new dictionary created.
